## 1\. Getting Started

First you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "officiel Nodejs website") on your computer. Then open a terminal (Your favorite terminal will be perfect), and now go to the directory base with the following command:

`cd path/to/the/directory/gulp-workflow`


## 2\. Installation

Here, you can install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/ "npmjs official website")(Node Package Manager) dependancies.

Run this command:

`npm install`

It installs all dependancies found in the `package.json`.


## 3\. Run it

Just run the following command line:
`gulp`

It execute the default task and launch the server.
I think it's better to show you this workflow in action. So the `index.html` is a kind of documentation and it can help you with some option.
